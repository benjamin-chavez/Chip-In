          The Real Junk Food Project Berlin is a collaborative effort to bring about a
          radical change in our food system. Founded by Tobias Goecke in June 2015, we
          are part of The Real Junk Food Project global network initiated in the UK.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our vision is to raise awareness of the huge amount of food that is wasted
          because food has to look beautiful to be consumable in the modern world we
          live in.
        </p>

        <p>We want to change this perception.</p>

        <p>
          Our strategy is to make meals that look as beautiful and mouth-watering as
          those in fine-dining restaurants and to appreciate the true beauty of food
          regardless of their appearance or age. We understand that a perfect meal is
          not only nutritionally balanced and good tasting but is also visually
          pleasing.
